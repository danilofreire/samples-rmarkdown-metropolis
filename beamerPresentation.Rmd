# Principal Resources

## Metropolis

### Main Repos

- [Official GitHub Repo of Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme)
  (formerly mtheme); older version in TeXLive 
- [My GitHub Repo for a local Ubuntu package of Metropolis](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/pkg-latex-metropolis) -- formerly mtheme
- [My GitHub Repo for a local Ubuntu package for the Fira font](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/pkg-fonts-fira) 

## Ubuntu and Launchpad

### Briefly

- The packages which can be built (ie not Fira as it needs external fonts
  which we cannot download during build) are
  [in this repo](https://launchpad.net/~edd/+archive/ubuntu/misc/+packages)
- If you're not on Ubuntu, it is probably more work to get
    - Metropolis into your \LaTeX environment
    - the Fira font into your \LaTeX environment
- I *did* try without (on plain Ubuntu 16.04) and it _builds_ but looks less
crisp
- So for the time being you probably want these fresh from source, or via my
helpers. YMMV.

## Local Adaption

- mtheme and metropolis changed a bit since I first used them
- I started with a local modification I called m2; the package is still in
the launchpad repo
- I generally include a file `header.tex` from the YAML for color, font,
  ... tweaking at the \LaTeX level, but as these are presentation-specific I
  didn't include any changes here.

## Using LaTeX Parts: Equations

### Linear Model

$$ \hat{\beta} = \text{argmin}_{b \in \mathbb{R}} S(b) = \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i^T \right)^{-1} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i  $$
or in matrix form

$$ \hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1} X^T y $$


## Using LaTeX Parts: Blocks

As one example of falling back into \LaTeX, consider the example of
three different block environments are pre-defined and may be styled
with an optional background color.

<!-- this sets the background -->
\metroset{block=fill} 

\begin{block}{Default}
  Block content.
\end{block}

\begin{alertblock}{Alert}
  Block content.
\end{alertblock}

\begin{exampleblock}{Example}
  Block content.
\end{exampleblock}
